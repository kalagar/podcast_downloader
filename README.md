## Architecture

The application follows a clean MVVM architecture with:

- **Models**: Core Data entities for persistent storage
- **ViewModels**: Observable classes managing UI state and business logic
- **Services**: Download and metadata extraction services
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for the user interface

### Key Components

- `LibraryViewModel`: Main view model managing the media library
- `DownloadService`: Handles media downloads and metadata extraction
- `PersistenceController`: Core Data stack management
- `MediaItem`: Core Data entity representing downloaded media

## Provider Plugin System

The application is designed to support additional media providers. To add a new provider:

1. Add a case to the `SourceProvider` enum
2. Implement metadata extraction in `DownloadService`
3. Add URL detection logic to `SourceProvider.detectProvider()`

## Storage

- **Database**: Core Data SQLite store in `~/Library/Application Support/PodLoad/`
- **Media Files**: Downloaded content in `~/Library/Application Support/PodLoad/Media/{source}/{id}/`
- **Settings**: App preferences stored using `@AppStorage`

## Testing

The project includes unit tests covering:

- Metadata extraction
- URL provider detection
- Core Data operations
- Download service functionality

Run tests with:
