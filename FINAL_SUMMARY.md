3. Implement real progress tracking

### Short-term (4-8 hours)

1. Complete Spotify API integration
2. Enhance RSS feed parsing
3. Add batch download capabilities
4. Final UI polish and animations

### Production (8-16 hours)

1. Code signing and notarization setup
2. App Store preparation
3. Advanced features (playlists, batch operations)
4. Performance optimization

## 💡 Key Insights

### Technical Learnings
